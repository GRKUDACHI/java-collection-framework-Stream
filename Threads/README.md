## üîë Key Concepts Covered

### Thread Creation Methods
1. **Extending Thread class**
2. **Implementing Runnable interface**
3. **Using Lambda expressions** (recommended for simple tasks)

### ExecutorService Types
- `newFixedThreadPool(n)` - Fixed number of threads
- `newCachedThreadPool()` - Creates threads as needed
- `newSingleThreadExecutor()` - Only one thread
- `newScheduledThreadPool(n)` - For scheduled tasks

### Synchronization Mechanisms
- `synchronized` methods and blocks
- `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, etc.
- `ReentrantLock`
- Thread-safe collections (`ConcurrentHashMap`, etc.)

### Background Processing
- Using `ExecutorService` for background tasks
- `Callable` and `Future` for returning results
- `CompletableFuture` for complex coordination

## üí° Quick Reference

### Create Thread with Lambda
```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    // Your code here
});
t.start();
```

### Create ExecutorService
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
```

### Submit Task to Executor
```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Your background task
});
```

### Shutdown Executor
```java
executor.shutdown();
executor.awaitTermination(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

## üéØ Common Use Cases

1. **Background Processing** - Keep UI responsive
2. **Parallel Processing** - Process data faster
3. **API Calls** - Make multiple calls simultaneously
4. **File Processing** - Process multiple files at once
5. **Database Operations** - Run queries in parallel

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always handle `InterruptedException`
- Always shutdown `ExecutorService` when done
- Use appropriate synchronization for shared resources
- Choose the right thread pool size
- Test your multithreaded code thoroughly

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure all files are in the same directory
2. Check that you have Java 8+ installed
3. Look for compilation errors in the console
4. Read the error messages carefully
