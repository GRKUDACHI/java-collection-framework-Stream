# ConcurrentHashMap Complete Tutorial Package

This collection provides comprehensive tutorials on ConcurrentHashMap - Java's thread-safe HashMap implementation designed for concurrent access.

## What is ConcurrentHashMap?

**ConcurrentHashMap** is a thread-safe implementation of the Map interface that allows multiple threads to read and write concurrently without external synchronization. It's designed for high-performance concurrent access scenarios.

## Key Features

### ✅ Thread Safety
- Multiple threads can access simultaneously
- No external synchronization needed
- Internal mechanisms handle concurrency

### ✅ High Performance
- Optimized for concurrent access
- Non-blocking read operations
- Segmented locking (Java 7) or CAS operations (Java 8+)

### ✅ Atomic Operations
- `putIfAbsent()` - atomic put if key doesn't exist
- `replace()` - atomic replace if current value matches
- `compute()` - atomic computation operations
- `merge()` - atomic merge operations

## Key Concepts

### Internal Architecture

**Java 7 Implementation:**
- Segment-based locking
- Each segment has its own lock
- Better concurrency than synchronized HashMap

**Java 8+ Implementation:**
- Removed segment-based locking
- Uses CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations
- Tree bins for high collision scenarios
- Lock-free read operations
- Fine-grained locking for write operations

### Time Complexity
- **Read operations**: O(1) non-blocking
- **Write operations**: O(1) with CAS/locking
- **Memory overhead**: Minimal compared to HashMap
- **Scalability**: Excellent for concurrent access

### Thread Safety Features
- **Non-blocking reads**: Read operations don't block other reads
- **Atomic operations**: Built-in atomic operations for common patterns
- **Lock-free algorithms**: Where possible, uses lock-free approaches
- **Segmented locking**: Only locks specific segments, not entire map

## When to Use ConcurrentHashMap

### ✅ Use ConcurrentHashMap When:
- Multi-threaded applications
- High-concurrency scenarios
- Cache implementations
- Shared data structures
- Producer-consumer patterns
- Need atomic operations
- Thread-safe iteration required

### ❌ Don't Use ConcurrentHashMap When:
- Single-threaded applications (HashMap is faster)
- Need ordered iteration (use LinkedHashMap)
- Need sorted keys (use TreeMap)
- Memory usage is critical (HashMap uses less memory)

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | HashMap | Synchronized HashMap | ConcurrentHashMap |
|---------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Thread Safety | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Performance | ✅ Fastest | ❌ Slow | ✅ Fast |
| Null Keys | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Null Values | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Read Operations | ✅ O(1) | ❌ Blocking | ✅ O(1) Non-blocking |
| Write Operations | ✅ O(1) | ❌ Blocking | ✅ O(1) Lock-free/CAS |

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Use ConcurrentHashMap for multi-threaded applications
- Prefer atomic operations (putIfAbsent, replace, compute)
- Use parallel operations for bulk processing
- Set appropriate initial capacity and load factor
- Use computeIfAbsent for lazy initialization

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't use external synchronization with ConcurrentHashMap
- Don't assume iteration is thread-safe (use entrySet())
- Don't modify map during iteration
- Don't use null keys or values
- Don't use for single-threaded applications

## Common Use Cases

1. **Web Application Session Storage**
   ```java
   ConcurrentHashMap<String, UserSession> sessions = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
   ```

2. **Cache Implementations**
   ```java
   ConcurrentHashMap<String, CachedData> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
   ```

3. **Configuration Management**
   ```java
   ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> config = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
   ```

4. **Counters and Statistics**
   ```java
   ConcurrentHashMap<String, AtomicInteger> counters = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
   ```

5. **Shared Lookup Tables**
   ```java
   ConcurrentHashMap<String, Object> lookupTable = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
   ```
